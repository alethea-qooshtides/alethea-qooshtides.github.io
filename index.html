    <main class="w3-container w3-large"> 
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">In the face of an ongoing crisis, we, the voices of reason and justice, rise with an unwavering determination to address the pressing issue that has plagued the Middle East for far too long. We demand, with an unyielding commitment, the immediate negotiation and resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">We declare it imperative to bring an immediate cessation to the turmoil and bloodshed that plagues the Middle East. The time for idleness and empty rhetoric has passed. We call upon all leaders of the Middle East to cast aside their differences and come together, without delay, to engage in meaningful, substantive and honest negotiations. The consequences of inaction and partisanship have already resulted in immense suffering and loss of life. We cannot, and will not, tolerate any further delay or reluctance to resolve this matter.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">The bloodshed, tears and shattered dreams endure in the hearts of countless innocent lives, both Israeli and Palestinian alike. It is our moral obligation to seek a just solution that recognizes the rights, aspirations and security of both nations. We must establish a platform for dialogue, where grievances are acknowledged, and common ground is sought in the pursuit of a prosperous and peaceful coexistence.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">Leaders of Israel, Palestine and the Arab World, we implore you to rise above personal interest, historical narratives and political calculus. We beseech you to envision a future where generations to come can live side by side, secure in their homes and united in their shared humanity. Though the trust between parties may be fractured, let it not hinder the pursuit of a just resolution that reconciles past injustices and works towards a sustainable peace. </p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">As an alternative to piecemeal normalization attempts and subject to the resolution of the Israel-Palestine issue, we propose a groundbreaking measure: the inclusion of Israel within the Arab League. By embracing the principles of unity and collaboration, we bridge divides, dispel animosity and foster an environment of mutual support among nations. This visionary step will safeguard the interests of Israel, Palestine and their neighbors, ensuring a collective future marked by cooperation, economic prosperity and shared values.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">To maintain peace and stability in the region, we advocate for the establishment of an independent peacekeeping force akin to NATO comprised of Israel and the Arab League nations. This joint effort will contextualize solidarity, pooling together resources and expertise to combat terrorism and safeguard the sovereignty of nations. Through a unified defense strategy, we can weather the threats that endanger peace and establish a strong framework for diplomatic progress.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">We acknowledge that the path to a resolution will be arduous and requires immense courage from both sides. However, we assert that the sacrifice of pride, the relinquishment of immovable positions and the acknowledgment of shared responsibilities are necessary steps towards a lasting peace. Let this be the watershed moment where leaders rise above political expediency and embrace their role as catalysts for transformative change.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">The international community must shoulder its responsibility to support and mediate this process. We call upon the Democratic Party, Conservative Party and the European Union to uphold impartiality and fairness as pillars of their agenda. The prioritization of neutrality and unbiased mediation in the pursuit of global peace should guide their actions.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">We call upon all nations, regardless of their biases or alliances, to lend their expertise, resources and influences to facilitate this negotiation. History has taught us that lasting peace requires a commitment from the global community to ensure the integrity and safety of any agreement reached. Failure to grasp this opportunity for negotiation and resolution will lead to continued suffering, widening divisions and the loss of yet more innocent lives. The consequences of such failure will bear heavily on all those who could have acted but chose passivity instead.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">Let us not allow the Western and Eastern voices who advocate the use of violence as the only viable means for conflict resolution to poison our quest for a better future. This path shall only lead to the repetition of relentless cycles of destruction. Instead, let diplomacy be our shield and understanding be our sword. </p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">To the Biden Administration, we beseech you to take these words to heart and act accordingly. As we approach the upcoming election, we citizens of conscience make this solemn pledge: If President Biden fails to bring Israel, Palestine and the Arab League together to engage in immediate and earnest negotiations to resolve the Israel-Palestine issue, we shall withhold our support, our trust and our precious votes. We refuse to support a leader whose values are indistinguishable from those that perpetuate division, who keeps his feet from the pathway to peace and leans towards violence as the answer. </p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">Silence in the face of injustice is acquiescence. We refuse to be complicit in the perpetuation of a conflict that engulfs hope and rends the fabric of humanity. We reiterate, we shall not endorse leaders who prioritize self-interest, empty rhetoric or complacency over the pursuit of justice and lasting peace.</p>
        <p class="w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-panel">Let history remember this as our call to action, embodying the spirit of the Declaration of Independence for the pursuit of a brighter and peaceful Middle East. Together, let us strive towards a future where nations overcome their differences, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and where justice and harmony prevail.</p>
